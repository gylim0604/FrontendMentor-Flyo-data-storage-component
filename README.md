## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

I felt that this was a good project to touch up on my flexbox skills. Most of the page was built using flexboxes. 

Once again, I continued using Sass for the project just to get a better understanding of it. Still not doing anything too fancy such as mixins tho. 

I feel the way I did the progress bar is flawed, using a absolute position for the indicator. A better way would probably not have the bar as an ::after pseudo element but an actual span/div, then have the indicator be an ::after pseudo element. I'm just a bit lazy to change it.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/) - Good guide for different shapes that can be done in css. Used it to create the triangle in the desktop view.
